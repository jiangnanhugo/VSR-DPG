# Symbolic Physics Learner: Discovering governing equations via Monte Carlo tree search:

SymbolicPhysicsLearner (SPL). We modify the data oracle for the algroithm to read the dataset.

## Run Model
 To run experiments with Symbolic Physics Learner, 

### Symbolic regression on algebraic equation
check the following file
```commandline
vim ./scripts/algebraic_equations/run_onekey.sh                               
```

### Symbolic regression on differential equation
check the following file
```commandline
vim ./scripts/differential_equations/run_onekey.sh
```
